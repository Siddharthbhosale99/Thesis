# 🤖 Interactive Scenario Design for Enhanced Chatbot Conversations

This project, built as part of my Master's Thesis, bridges advanced conversational AI with user-friendly design. It combines fine-tuned **DialoGPT** with **FAISS** retrieval to enable personalized, context-aware multi-turn chatbot interactions—without requiring any coding knowledge from end users.

## 🎯 Objective
Enable non-technical users to design adaptive, intelligent chatbot flows via a drag-and-drop visual interface, while leveraging the power of large language models and retrieval-augmented generation.

## 🧠 Key Features
- **Hybrid Chatbot Architecture:** Combines a fine-tuned DialoGPT model with FAISS vector search for context retention and memory recall.
- **Interactive Scenario Designer:** No-code interface allows users to create structured dialogues using a flowchart-based system.
- **Personalization & Consent:** Supports GDPR-compliant user profiling and dynamic personalization.
- **Retrieval Layer:** Improves factual accuracy and grounding using vector-based semantic search.

## 🔍 Research Highlights
- Compared T5, LoRA, and DialoGPT for dialogue generation.
- Integrated decision tree logic with neural fallback for seamless flow control.
- Evaluated chatbot quality using BLEU, ROUGE, METEOR, and BERTScore.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Python**, **Transformers (DialoGPT)**, **FAISS**, **Streamlit**, **LoRA**
- **Evaluation Metrics:** BLEU, ROUGE, METEOR, BERTScore
- **Design Paradigm:** Hybrid rule-based + neural + retrieval architecture

## 📈 Outcomes
- Enhanced chatbot coherence in multi-turn dialogues
- Empowered non-technical users with easy design interface
- Enabled privacy-aware personalization in conversational flows

## 📎 Thesis Access
